### What I learned

With this project I learn how to design a responsive element and the principles of Flexbox system design

My best code snippets to share with you!

```css
.container {
    margin: auto;
    position: absolute;
    top: 25%;
    left: 45%;
    right: 40%;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    border-radius: 5%;
    box-shadow: 10px 5px 30px rgba(191, 190, 190, 0.5);
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I will improve in responsive design and elements position system.
